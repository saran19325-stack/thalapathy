Page 11: Seat Arrangement Strategy (The Core)
11.1 Tier-Based Categorization
The system must support a minimum of three tiers per screen:
1.	Platinum (VIP): Top-tier recliners, extra legroom, call-button service.
2.	Gold (Premium): Middle rows, optimized viewing angle.
3.	Silver (Executive): Front rows, budget-friendly pricing.
11.2 The 2D/3D Grid Logic
•	Dynamic Grid: Admins can define Row_ID (A-Z) and Seat_No (1-30).
•	Pricing Matrix: * $Silver Price = Base$
o	$Gold Price = Base \times 1.5$
o	$Platinum Price = Base \times 2.2$
Page 12: Real-time Seat Locking Logic
•	Pessimistic Locking: Once a user clicks a seat, it is "Yellow" (Blocked) for all other users for 10 minutes.
•	Redis Implementation: Keys expire automatically if the user abandons the checkout.
Page 13: Food & Beverage (F&B) Integration
•	Upselling: Show "Combos" (Popcorn + Soda) immediately after seat selection.
•	Skip Option: Users can bypass F&B to go directly to payment.
Page 14: Checkout & Order Summary
•	Tax Engine: Automated calculation of CGST (9%) and SGST (9%).
•	Convenience Fee: Platform fee per ticket (e.g., ₹25/ticket).
•	Promo Codes: Validation engine for seasonal discounts.
Page 15: Multi-Channel Payment Gateway
•	Aggregators: Razorpay, BillDesk, and CCAvenue.
•	Features: UPI Intent, EMI options for high-value event tickets, and "Buy Now Pay Later."

•	M-Ticket: SVG-based QR code containing Booking_ID and Secret_Key.

Page 17: User Profile & History
•	Booking History: Detail of every transaction with "Re-book" functionality.
•	Refund Tracker: Status of cancelled tickets (Initiated $\rightarrow$ Processed $\rightarrow$ Credited).
Page 18: Admin Dashboard (Content & Analytics)
•	CMS: Theater owners can upload bulk showtimes via CSV.
•	Heatmaps: Visualizing which seats (Silver/Gold/Platinum) sell fastest to adjust pricing.
Page 19: Security & Compliance
•	Encryption: AES-256 for sensitive user data.
•	Compliance: PCI-DSS for payments and GDPR for user privacy.
•	Bot Protection: Google reCAPTCHA v3 on the "Proceed to Pay" button.
Page 20: Scalability & Disaster Recovery
•	Load Balancing: AWS ELB to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.
•	Auto-Scaling: Spin up new servers automatically when concurrent users exceed 50,000.
•	Backup: Hourly snapshots of the database to prevent data loss.
Page 21: Sports Category - Discovery & UX
21.1 Sport-Specific Landing Page
Unlike movies, sports fans search by Tournament or Team.
•	Tournament Buckets: IPL, ISL, Pro Kabaddi, Wimbledon, ICC World Cup.
•	Team Follow: Users can "Follow" a team (e.g., CSK or Manchester United) to get push notifications for ticket sales.
•	Match-Day Widgets: Live countdown timers for the next big match on the homepage.

Page 22: Stadium Seating & Tiered Categories
22.1 Large-Scale Venue Mapping
Stadiums have thousands of seats, making a single grid impossible. We implement a Sector-Based Selection:
1.	Level 1: The Bird's Eye View: An SVG map of the entire stadium divided into Stands (North Stand, East Stand, Pavillion).
2.	Level 2: Stand Selection: User clicks "East Stand" to see specific blocks.
3.	Level 3: Block View: Detailed seat selection (Silver, Gold, Platinum).
22.2 Tiered Pricing for Sports
•	Platinum (VIP/Hospitality): Includes AC lounge access, unlimited F&B, and celebrity stand access.
•	Gold (Premium Stands): Best viewing angles (Long-on, Long-off in Cricket).
•	Silver (General Admission): High-energy fan zones, usually behind the goals or sightscreen.

Page 23: Sports-Specific Functional Requirements
23.1 Merchandise Upselling
During the booking flow, offer team jerseys or fan kits.
•	Logic: If "CSK vs MI" is selected, show CSK and MI official jerseys in the "Add-ons" page.
•	Data Fields: Item_ID, Size (S, M, L, XL), Quantity.
23.2 Physical Ticket Delivery (High Security)
Many major sporting events require physical tickets/wristbands for security.
•	Courier Integration: Integration with BlueDart/Delhivery APIs.
•	Box Office Pickup: Option to collect tickets at the stadium "Counter 4" with a digital receipt.
•	Address Validation: Mandatory PIN code check for home delivery availability.
